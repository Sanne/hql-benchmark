= HQL Benchmark

Benchmark testing HQL parsing and semantic analysis between different versions of Hibernate.

Each version must be run individually and the results can be compared using from the results file for
each of the runs.  To run using Hibernate 5.3, use:

````
gradlew clean jmh -Porm5
````

To run using Hibernate 6.0

````
gradlew clean jmh
````

Additionally the "dot identifier sequence" PoC can be tested using:

````
gradlew clean jmh -Pseqpoc
````
